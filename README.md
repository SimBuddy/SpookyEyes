Spooky Eyes on two ESP32-TFT Displays

This project will display eyes on two synced ESP LCD boards, so they will act as a pair, like eyes do.  The make a great spooky addittion to halloween.  They also look good in masks and under veils.

I chose two of these from Ali Express, based on the GC9A01 TFT.
